## Online/Offline Budget Trackers


## Description
These budget trackers were created so that when a traveller is in a remote area and cannot access wifi or internet connection, they are still able to use the application to track their expenses.  The app will be able to record all transactions entered online and offline, and if added when offline, the information entered will update once connection has been restored.


## Business Context
Giving users a fast and easy way to track their money is important, but allowing them to access that information anytime is even more important. Having offline functionality is paramount to our applications success.


## Technologies

Express<br>

## Features
Enter deposits offline<br>

## User Story
AS AN avid traveller<br>
